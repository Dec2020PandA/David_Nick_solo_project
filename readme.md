## David Nick - Solo Project Proposal (Coding Dojo):
>    My future goal is to move toward a career in data science, and as such I wish to create a Python-driven site that can transition to that focus and easily upscale to one which utilizes data analysis. The site needs to pull from a large database and/or multiple sources of aggregated data, combined succinctly to provide current market summaries. This project will be a website geared toward prospective renters, who want to find basic information about the current status of different markets for rental homes.  The base site could be geared to large-scale "markets" (major cities) or even customized and tailored to narrow each "market" down to individual neighborhoods, depending upon the needs and specificity required by the end user.

# What's New to Me:
>    1) Google or other Maps APIs
>    
>    2) Utilizing data from a 3rd party API (Rent Estimate by Rapid API)
>    
>    3) Embedding images and videos in a site
>    
>    4) Having an image-based background on each page
>    
>    5) Maximizing Bootstrap usage

# Features List:
>    P0: must haves, basic required functionality and functionality-required features
        - Django Admin
        - Dropdown Menus corresponding to criteria (select by market or by rent range)
        - Templates
        - Images

>    P1: necessary features (beyond fundamentals) to showcase the purpose of the website
        - Bootstrap CSS
        - Back-end database management for each "market", containing its vital information
        - Proper many-to-many links

>    P2: nicer features you may not get to right away but are needed for overall product down the road
		- Rent Estimate API
        - Finding a way to pull in and measure raw data, in terms of $/square foot for the "markets" referenced
        - Tutorial or Marketing Videos on landing page to draw in prospective users

>	P3 and beyond: plans for the future of the project, fleshing it out to be "portfolio worthy"
        Integrate a larger-scale database of properties from other 3rd party API's (Zillow and/or Redfin, for example)
        Pull median rent information based on determined market sizes
        Upscale to include 1000s of different "markets" - giving users many more options thus being viable for more people
